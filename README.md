Motivation
----------
"The non-consensus idea is the only way to achieve extraordinary results in *anything*." - Doug Clinton
<br> 
<br>
Main St. vs. Wall St. - Pushing Back Against the Establishment 


<br>
<br> Hedge funds and other financial institutions are know for colluding and profiting off of insider trading and other shared secrets. In 2021, GameStop, an American video game retailer, experienced a short squeeze initiated by Reddit's subreddit r/wallstreetbets. Reddit is a social news website that started the retail vs. establishment movement in investments. Since then, Reddit and subreddits like r/wallstreetbets has transformed into a platform for sharing investment recommendations and discussion. 

<br>
* As more players participate in markets, alternative data sources are being utilized to generate alpha or above market returns
<br>
* Unconventional data can provide insights that other market participants haven't considered
<br>
* Investors who use the same resources can only achieve the ordinary. Only the non-concensus investor can yield the *extraordinary* 

GameStop Short Squeeze: A phenomenon in finance when there is a lack of supply and an excess of demand for the stock due to short sellers having to buy stocks to cover their short positions, thus causing a sharp increase in share price

Problem Statement
