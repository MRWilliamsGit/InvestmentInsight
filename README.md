Main St. vs. Wall St. - Pushing Back Against the Establishment 
<br>
<br> Hedge funds and other financial institutions are know for colluding and profiting off a insder trading and other shared secrets. In 2021, GameStop, an American video game retailer, experienced a short squeeze initiated by the Reddit's subreddit r/wallstreetbets. Reddit is a social news website that started the retail vs. establishment movement in investments. Since then, Reddit and subreddits like r/wallstreetbets has been used as reference for investment recommendations and discussion.
