Motivation

"Software is eating the world." - Marc Andreessen
<br> 
Main St. vs. Wall St. - Pushing Back Against the Establishment 
<br>
<br> Hedge funds and other financial institutions are know for colluding and profiting off a insder trading and other shared secrets. In 2021, GameStop, an American video game retailer, experienced a short squeeze initiated by the Reddit's subreddit r/wallstreetbets. Reddit is a social news website that started the retail vs. establishment movement in investments. Since then, Reddit and subreddits like r/wallstreetbets has been used as reference for investment recommendations and discussion. 

GameStop Short Squeeze: A phenomenon in finance when there is a lack of supply and an excess of demand for the stock due to short sellers having to buy stocks to cover their short positions, thus causing a sharp increase in share price
